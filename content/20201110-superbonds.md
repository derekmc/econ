# Superbonds are the "Next Best Thing"
### How to emulate Monetary Sovereignty
##### Derek McDaniel - Nov 10, 2020

## Monetary Sovereignty and MMT

MMT is obsessed with the notion of monetary sovereignty.  If you are monetary sovereign, that gives
you complete financial self-determination.  If you want to buy more stuff, you can do it, and no
one can stop except to the degree they honor your credit, and specifically at the point of sale.
Effectively, you have no credit limit within the scope where your currency serves as the only means
of payment, regardless of what "investors" or *currency savers*, think.

It is important to understand that people care much less about returns on investment or inflation,
than the total amount they can save.  Generally, people would rather have the ability to work 100
hours to get $1,000, than if they could only work for 10 hours and then they earned a 5% interest
rate on that.  Returns are not the only consideration, when you can

People tend to forget that
"trading" is not the only way to acquire a currency, and this is one reason why monetary
sovereignty must be evaluated differently from other forms of credit acceptance.  If you have to
trade into a spendable medium, that limits the immediacy of financial self determination.

MMTers don't typically discuss this, but having the flexibility to choose to accept different means
of payment is the super secret to true financial self-determination... So if you don't want to accept
dollars, you don't have to.  The only sense in which you are legally obligated to accept dollars, is
in civil legal matters, such as tortious debts.  If you sue someone for a million dollars, they
will always be able to settle that with the sovereign currency.

## The conversion rate is your credit score

Well of course, we here at the economics now blog(1 person as of now) want everyone to have the ability to issue their own spendable
medium of exchange, but.. that's not easy, so we issue
superbonds to allow us the maximum flexibility in the mean time.  Effectively, you issue bonds in
your own unit of account, a "financial currency", if you will.  Then the "exchange rate" for your
currency, takes the place of a credit score.

This means, that, as your credit score goes down, you have to pay back less.  Investors determine
your credit score both by trading to purchase newly issued tokens when you want to raise more
capital, and by bidding on your stream of based currency repayments with matured tokens.  To allow
for some flexibility, you can allow investors to "cash out" to your virtual tokens early, based on
how long they waited.  If they wait to half the maturity, they only get 50% out.  If they wait 90%
of the time, they get 90% of the mature amount out.  Because they are cashing out to get your
virtual tokens, and then using your tokens to bid on the repayment stream in the base currenc(ies),
there is no reaon not to allow people to cash out early at a discount.

If you structure it correctly, and everyone waits until full maturity, then the repayment stream
should cover all "cash-outs" at 100%.  However, if people get skiddish, this allows them to jump
ship early, without having to sell their securities to other investors.  On the other hand, if you
face unexpected contingencies, you can taper down your repayment stream, with the understanding,
that people will either have to wait or buy more securities until they can cash out.  But the point
is, it let's you control the bankruptcy process and repayment schedule, with the understanding that
not keeping your word, by extending the schedule or reducing total payments, will hurt your ability
to raise capital in the future.


There are two possible ways you can induce investors to buy your "self-tokenized" securities.  The
standard way is the traditional mechanism of offering a bond with a certain premium or coupon once it matures.
So you can sell a $100, 5 year bond for $95, or whatever specific return you want to offer.  Then, 
if you sell $12,000 of bonds extending up to 10 years, you schedule your monthly repayments, which
in this case would require $100/month.  As people's bonds mature, the pool of "reserves" for
repayment is full, so they can cash out of the bonds at full face value.

Let's say that something happens, and then you are forced to lower your monthly payments to $80 for
a time.  Then, as people's bonds mature, there will be more people holding your virtual currency,
than is available in the reserves for repayment.  Let's say 85% of investors decide to cashout
anyway, and 15% decide to wait until the reserves are there to cashout at full value.  So the
cashout value is bid down to 80/85 or $94.12 on $100.  This amount is called the "cash-out" rate.

The other way you can induce people to buy bonds, is to offer a discount at the "buy-in" rate over
the "cash-out" rate.  This essentially means you are debasing your currency, so that the new
investors get a better conversion rate than the former security purchasers.  So if the current
cashout rate is 95%, then you can offer a buy-in rate of 90%, such that new security buyers only
have to pay 90 cents on the dollar, and can anticipate getting 95 cents on the dollar, when they
cash out, in addition the amount that their bonds earn.
