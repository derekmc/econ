### It's about supporting a stock using a flow.

## What is the *Credit Problem*?

The problem of issuing credit is typically seen as problem of trust or setting
the cost of borrowing in terms of some kind of interest rate. However, it is 
possible to view credit entirely in terms of creating your own form of currency.

When someone accepts your credit in exchange for some type of loan, they are in
effect, holding a form of money or currency which you have created.  There are
two principle factors which prevent it from being used as currency outright:

 1. General Acceptability
 2. Risk of Default

If you can get your credit to be generally acceptable, and eliminate the risks
of default, then your credit can, in effect, serve as a form of currency. This
is, in fact the purpose of issuing what is referred to as "securities".
Securities refer to a financial asset which can be traded or exchanged with
other parties.

While very few financial assets can achieve the formal status of "currency", ie
a medium of exchange and unit of account in which prices are denominated, the
ability to freely trade credit, in the form of a security, makes credit
relationships much more flexible.  Specifically, if your creditor decides that
he wants to in effect "call in" the money you owe him, he can simply sell that
security to some other creditor, instead of having to badger you for money
before it's due.

When credit is not securitized, this process becomes much more complicated.
Either your creditor uses your asset as collateral to get credit themselves, or
they must go through complicated legal chicanery to get them replaced on the
contract so that another party takes their place.  "Securitizing" a loan, takes
care of this beforehand, eliminating the headaches of collateralizing or
transfering the loan.

By issuing tokenized debt securities, instead of simply "getting a loan", it
makes it possible for your creditors to freely use your contract in exchanges
and trade it with others. In essence, you are turning a flow(the promise to
repay money on regular intervals) into a stock (the tokenized debt securities
which can be freely traded).

The final result, is that the interest rate approaches or achieves a zero or
negative rate.  This is because nobody in fact cares about an interest rate,
they only care about their total wealth.  Interest has nothing to do with which
asset people will accept, or how they price those assets for exchange, but
instead only influences which assets they would prefer to *hold*.

It is, in fact, impossible for all assets to have a real positive interest
rate, because interest is denominated by comparing some assets to others.  The
fact that one asset accrues interest, must simultaneously mean that, relatively
speaking some other asset is depreciating.  A depreciating asset, however, is
not worthless, it is not undesirable to *accept* a depreciating asset, only
to *hold* it, so long as that is avoidable.

Thus, in accordance with "Greshm's" so-called "Law", the currency will generally
depreciate.  Greshm's law makes no sense, because any party receiving an asset
will always want the highest quality thing, and any party spending an asset will
want to use the lowest quality thing.  So this so called phenomenon of Greshm's
law, is more a consequence that the more widely acceptable an item is for
payment, the less one is worried about depreciation or debasement, because they
can always offload the item when they wish.  So widely accepted assets tend to
debase or depreciate, but it is not true in general that depreciating assets
will gain wide use or acceptance as currency.  The logic of Greshm's Law fails
because it only considers the incentives of the party spendin a currency and not
the party accepting it.

That aside, one will tolerate disparities of interest or returns, if it in fact
allows them to increase their total net worth.  No one will refuse to pick up a
10 dollar bill off the ground, simply because it is depreciating.  When deciding
to pick it up they consider the *total* value of the asset, and not the *change
in value over time*.

Sophisticated parties may in fact, compute the *present value* of an asset, but
if an asset can be easily bought or sold on the market the *present value* and
the *market value* are tautologically the same.

But even when an asset is not marketable, it's *total value* is much more
important, than its *rate of change*.  An asset worth $1,000,000 which
depreciates 10% per year, will be more desired than an asset worth only $100
which **appreciates** at 10% per year.

It is in fact possible for the total wealth in the world to constantly be
increasing, even the value of any particular asset is rapidly depreciating.  The
difference of course being, that you are *creating* new things.

This mindset of constant creation and depreciation, may in fact, be the most
healthy and robust way to view finance.  Hopefully the expectation of interest
and appreciation will soon become an awkward relic from an uncomfortably
disfunctional past.

In the mean time, learning how to securitize your personal credit, can be
beneficial, in that it will allow you to engage in exchange openly and fairly
without dependency on any specific institution or government for a loan or to
facilitate a payment system.  In this essay, I will go over a general scheme for
turning a flexible flow of payments (your credit), into a stock of tradeable
securities which you can use to finance any type of operation.

The important factor, is that you are not dependent on any party setting or
fixing a rate of interest on you.  Ultimately, your securities will be accepted,
provided that you are reliable, because accepting credit increases the total
amount of wealth in the world.  Accepting credit is basically a form of time
travel, where future value can be instantly realized in the present day, which
like all forms of time travel, violates any temporal notion of conservation of
matter-energy.  Just like a time traveller from the future moving into the past
increases the total mass in the universe, issuing securities based on future
payment flows is a simple way to hack the universe and increase total wealth,
and if successful, enjoy zero or negative interest rates.  I hope you enjoy!

## With the right contractual structure, anyone can simulate enjoying their own currency

The purpose of this scheme is to allow anyone to functionally enjoy "monetary
sovereignty, which gives them control over their own rate of interest on their
outstanding debts.

## Relating a flow to a stock

Thus, the *Credit Problem*, is one of relating a flow to stock.  On the one hand, you have a *stock*
of **tokenized debt securities**, and on the other hand you have a *flow* of redeemable payments.

The token issuer offers a *flow* in order to stabilized the *stock*.  A helpful visual imagery is
a lake, which you would like to keep at a constant water level.  Having both a stream coming in, and
a stream going out, helps to maintain that constant level.  


## Bidding on the Flow, Using the Stock

Imagine that you have a run on a bank, such that customers attempt to withdraw all available
reserves.  While publicly backed insurance schemes, such as the FDIC are the best way to ensure that
all deposits are available at face value, it is easy to design a simple and fair "failure" protocol,
which turn bank "runs" into a fair proposition among customers-- provided that the condition that
deposits are honored at face value is suspended.

The first step of such a protocol would be to "freeze and notify", meaning that, all customer
depository accounts and payments are frozen, and all customers are notified that this protocol is
being activated.  After the notification period, perhaps 3-5 days, customers are then allowed to use
their deposit balances to bid on the available reserves.  In the mean time, the bank continues
operating otherwise.

After "freeze and notify" the "deposit holders" are then allowed to use their deposit balances to
"bid" on the reserves, as well as the incoming payments from accounts receivable when they come in.
So imagine there are $1,000 dollars of deposits, and $100 dollars of reserves.  The deposit holders
could bid, perhaps $2 or $3 dollars of deposits for those reserves.  Any deposit holder can make a
bid, and a price of $10 would in fact clear all the deposits.  But let's say that all those reserves
are auctioned off, at a price of $2.50(two dollars and fifty cents).  Then the remaining deposits would
total $750.  Those depositors would then have to wait for more payments to come in and could bid on
those.  In this manner, there is no "rush" to extract reserves, because all customers have the same
opportunity to bid on their reserves, and they are merely honored at the trading price or auctioned
ratio.  If in fact, the institution was still solvent, but simply illiquid, then when the remaining
$900 of debts are received, the depositors who waited would get $900 for their deposits of $750.


On the other hand, if the 

While this could be a failure protocol for a bank to handle situations of illiquidity, and restore
their solvency, in both a fair and flexible way, it would also be possible to issue bonds in which
all redemption was based on a stock of tokenized securities being used to bid on a flow of


## Mature tokens

Once a token is mature it may be held indefinitely at face value, exchanged,
used to bid on token flows, or rolled over into new bonds.

## The flow is subject to change at any time (but not without affecting investor credit)


## Continuously Maturing Bonds

A continuously maturing bond is one which is callable at any time, at a certain percentage of face
value.  A linearly maturing bond offers 0% call value at the time it is issued, and 100% call value
upon its date of maturity.  So the call value *v* is *v = xt/t1*, where *x* is the face value, t is
the elapsed time, and t1 is the point of maturation.

## Inverted or Recursive Reserves

Central banks have "inverted reserves". While the system uses fed notes as
reserves, the fed uses diversified assets as its reserves, because it can always
print money, but it can't directly back the money.  This is why a central bank
must use "inverted reserves".  The item considered to be reserves by the banking
system, is a liability of the central bank, and they must use something else as
reserves.
