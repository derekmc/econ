<p>The stated goal of this blog is to allow people to securitize their own credit, thus creating their
own currency.  This is achieved by turning a flow (of repayments) into a stock (of callable linearly
maturing credit instruments).  In this vein, it is important to understand why inflation occurs in
general, and why it is <em>not theft</em>.</p>

<p>Inflation, or better stated, depreciation, is the downgrading in the value of an asset over time.
Here we focus on guaranteeing limits on asset appreciation, and not trying to make guarantees
against downgrading or depreciation.  Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is lying.  The only
guarantees you can make on the downward end are that you guarantee complete failure instead of xyz
outcome.  While that may be useful for somethings, we think finance should involve loose coupling
between people.  We are not fans of <a href="./20201104-lust-cycle.html">all or nothing thinking</a>.</p>

<p>So why is depreciation not theft?  Well the idea being, everybody loses together.  So no it is not
theft.</p>
