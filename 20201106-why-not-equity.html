<p>In this blog we advocate issuing tokenized debt securities, in other words, your own currency. So
the question is clearly &quot;why not equity&quot;.  Well the biggest problem is that equity relies on
offering an unlimited upside, so it is intrinsically not democratic and oriented toward abusive
exploitation</p>

<p>Equity is either underpriced when it is issued, or overpriced when it peaks.  It is a game of
russian roulette, and really unnecessary.  Furthermore, it is an inherently unstable governance
structure.  Do you really want to be in bed with millions of other people, some of whom take up most
of the bed??? -- NOT FUN.</p>

<p>So here we guarantee limited upside, non-competitive returns, and recognize potential loses or
negative returns.  Here, if your credit gets downgraded, you pay back less, not more.  Well, really
those two things are the same event.  We don&apos;t recommend charging or offering more returns to
address bad credit.  We recommend
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com?q=do+things+that+dont+scale+paul+graham">scaling down</a>.</p>

<p>If you have to pay too much interest(credit inefficiency), then you are overleveraged.  You should
be scaling down, brinksmanship is for people who don&apos;t know how to lose.  Once you know how to be a
loser, you don&apos;t have to be a bully.</p>

<p>We Increase Total Wealth by creating more assets, not by appreciating the assets that exist.  Making
your credit instruments callable against a flow of repayments is only really a way to bootstrap your
own currency.  The final result being, no need for repayments at all, only defining succession.
That&apos;s how you know that you&apos;ve MADE IT, when society just accepts your credit because they know you
are doing Good Shit(tm).</p>
