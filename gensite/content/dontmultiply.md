# Multiplicative Accounting Is Obselete
### Addition is more accurate than multiplication
Derek McDaniel - Nov 4, 2020

Interest rate "logic" is frequently justified with *multiplicative accounting*.  Multiplicative
accounting is just the practice of comparing quantities proportionally, using mulplication.  There
are 2 problems with multiplicative accounting:
 1. Loses Precision
 2. Hides Scale

## Loses Precision

It may sound superfluous to worry about interest rates down to many decimal places, but this adds up
very quickly.  If you are buying a half million dollar home, not too uncommon in the U.S. today,
then a hundredth of a percent, or one ten-thousandth, is $50 a year.  Most of us would notice if
someone tried to sneak in an extra $50, even if the price tag was pretty big $500,050.  But how many
people are going to care about a 2.01% interest rate over 2%?

When you consider a something bigger, the issue of lost precision becomes even more important.

A 0.01% change in the interest on the national debt amounts to $3 billion dollars a year, which is
about $30 per U.S. citizen, or 6,000 half a million dollar homes.

## Hides Scale 

If you make 1% per year on a billion dollars, that's 10 million dollars.  If you make 1% a year
on $10, that's only 10 cents.  By using multiplicative accounting, it looks like paying someone with
$10 of net wealth is as impactful as paying

This gets even worse once you consider that many people have an essentially negative "net worth",
though stricly in financial terms that should lead to bankruptcy, it is hard to measure intangibles
and lifetime potential earnings, both of which should technically be included in net worth.

But if someone's financial accounts are in the red, this type of measurement makes it seem fair to
charge them more money.

In reality, scale matters.  You can't simply take the $27 trillion dollars that are currently
invested in treasury bonds, and put them into Apple Stock instead.  Apple would never be able to
handle that, and the company would become completely unproductive.

## Additive accounting is easy with computers, and simply better overall.

Instead of trying to turn everything into products and ratios, just add things up and compare them.
